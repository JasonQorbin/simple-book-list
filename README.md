# Simple Book List

An exercise in using session storage in a website, by simulating a book reading
list.

## Usage

- Add a book to the list by filling in the relevant information and clicking the "Add"
  button. The books will appear in a grid in the order they were added.
- Edit books by clicking the pencil icon in the book's card. The book's information will
  be entered into the entry form so that you can edit it and resubmit.
- The information will persist as long as the browser tab remains open (the session 
  remains active). Once the tab is closed the information is deleted.
